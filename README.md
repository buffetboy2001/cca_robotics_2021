**NOTE**: This guide will be changing continuously until the end of the 21/22 academic year.

## Course Goals

A basic instruction to the interdisciplinary world of robotics will be covered. Students are not expected to have any technical background at all, but will learn little-by-little along the way using hands-on projects.

We'll cover:

* Wiring sensors of various types;
* Raspberry Pi computing;
* Python computer programming on the Raspberry Pi

## Project Summary

This year there will be two different robots being assembled:

1. Adeept 4DOF [Robot Arm](https://www.robotshop.com/en/adeept-rasparm-s-4-dof-robotic-arm-kit-raspberry-pi.html) for R-Pi
2. Tank Steering Vehicle using a Xiaor Geek [Tank Chassis](https://www.xiaorgeek.com/store/robot-accessories/multi-color-th-tank-chassis-kit-with-2wd-motors.html)

Students that are returning for year two of Robotics will build the robot arm. Students in their first year of Robotics will build the tank.
