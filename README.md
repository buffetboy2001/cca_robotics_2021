## cca_robotics_2021

Course materials for 2021-22 robotics high-school class at [Cornerstone Classical Academy Roanoke](https://cornerstoneclassicalroanoke.org/).

Course Instructor: Stuart Bowman (e.g. [buffetboy2001 on GitHub](https://github.com/buffetboy2001), [faculty listing](https://cornerstoneclassicalroanoke.org/stuart-bowman))

## Course Goals

A basic instruction to the interdisciplinary world of robotics will be covered. Students are not expected to have any technical background at all, but will learn little-by-little along the way using hands-on projects.

We'll cover:

* Wiring sensors of various types;
* Raspberry Pi computing;
* Python computer programming on the Raspberry Pi

## Project Summary

This year there will be two different robots being assembled:

1. Adeept 4DOF [Robot Arm](https://www.robotshop.com/en/adeept-rasparm-s-4-dof-robotic-arm-kit-raspberry-pi.html) for R-Pi
2. Tank Steering Vehicle using a Xiaor Geek [Tank Chassis]()

Students that are returning for year two of Robotics will build the robot arm. Students in their first year of Robotics will build the tank.
