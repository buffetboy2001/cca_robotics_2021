# Robot Tank Assembly

The Xioar Tank robot platform is great! The chassis is large, so plenty of room to connect the Raspberry Pi and fun sensors. Step through these modules to get it all working.

## Drive System Assembly

## Vehicle Control

\>> [Take control of the tank](./vehicle_control.md)

## Add the Line Sensors

\>> [Let's start line sensing!](./line_sensors.md)

## Line Following

\>> [Use the sensors to follow a line](./line_following.md)

## Obstacle Sensing

## Raspberry Pi Interaction

You need to learn how to use your Raspberry Pi as a computer. First learn how to use it when connected to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. It'll be awesome! This module will be taught in-class -- no printed materials necessary.

Once you've mastered the basics, then learn how to use your Kano computer to [connect wirelessly](./raspberry_pi_comms.md) to your Raspberry Pi. You'll need this skill also in order to control your vehicle when the Raspberry Pi is on it.

# Robot Arm Guide 

## Assembly

The Adeept Robot Arm can be assembled by following these resources: 

* Build Tutorial Video (really good, for R-Pi model): https://www.adeept.com/video/detail-136.html
* Online [course guide](https://www.adeept.com/learn/tutorial-291.html) by Adeept.
* Tutorial w/ PDFs: https://www.adeept.com/learn/detail-53.html
* [PDF Document](https://www.adeept.com/video/static1/itemsfile/RaspArmS_Tutorial.pdf) for building;

Make sure you assemble the arm correctly. It's easy to put the gripper on upside down and make other silly mistakes that could make the arm not work properly. Also, double check your wiring according to Section 5.3 and Section 10 of the [online course guide](https://www.adeept.com/learn/tutorial-291.html).

## Arm Control

Major steps to follow in the [course guide](https://www.adeept.com/learn/tutorial-291.html).

* Section 5. Learn to control the OLED screen.

## Color Sensing

\>> [Yup, you can sense color!](./tcs3200_color_sensor.md)
