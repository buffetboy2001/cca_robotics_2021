# Raspberry Pi Interaction

You need to learn how to use your Raspberry Pi as a computer. First learn how to use it when connected to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. It'll be awesome! This module will be taught in-class -- no printed materials necessary.

Once you've mastered the basics, then learn how to use your Kano computer to [connect wirelessly](./raspberry_pi_comms.md) to your Raspberry Pi. You'll need this skill also in order to control your vehicle when the Raspberry Pi is on it.
