# Vehicle Control

**Module Goal**: learn to make Robby go left & right.

Let's learn how to turn `Robby` left and right.

## Stop & Turn

When you have a two-wheeled drive system like `Robby`, the wheels provide both the drive motion of the vehicle and also the steering control. How is that? Think of a tank. It only has tracks and yet it goes forward, backward, left, and right. Why? Because it can make the two tracks turn opposite directions from each other. 

`Robby` can do the same thing with its wheels!

In the python language we're using, we have some commands that will help us do this:
* `stop()` will make the wheels stop spinning;
* `sleep()` will make the current motion continue for some amount of time;
* `left()` will make `Robby` turn left;
* `right()` will make `Robby` turn right.

Time to try it out. In `code-oss`, create a new file and add this:

```python
#!/bin/python3

# our team's left turn module
from gpiozero import Robot
import time

# Students: you may need to modify the left/right numbers
#           based on your wiring choices!
robby = Robot(left=(7, 8), right=(9, 10))

robby.left()
time.sleep(1.0)
robby.stop()
```

Make sure you save it: `turn_left.py`.

Then run it. In the terminal ![](./pics/terminal_icon_small.jpg):

* If you need to, change directories by typing `cd cca_robotics` and then **Enter**
* `python3 turn_left.py` and then **Enter**

`Robby` should have turned left by some amount. Maybe not much, maybe a lot. Discuss what happened.

**Challenge**: what can you do to make `Robby` turns a precise 90-degrees? Make it happen!

## Turn Right

To turn right, just change one line of code. I bet you can guess which one :grin:

Change `robby.left()` to `robby.right()`!

## Turning While Going Forward

Now, the code you've written so far makes `Robby` stop before turning. But, that's not super practical. Let's make `Robby` turn while driving forward.

Modify the code above to this:

```python
robby.forward(curve_right=1)
```

Or, you can use `curve_left`. But, you can't use them both at the same time :grin:

**Challenge**: what can you do to make `Robby` turns in a circle (left or right)? Make it happen!
