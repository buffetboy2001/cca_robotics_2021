# Adeept Python Code Installation

Turn on the Raspberry Pi on your robot arm. Make sure you have connected a monitor, mouse, and keyboard. Open a terminal and type this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/buffetboy2001/adeept_rasparms.git
```

Once that completes, type these commands:

```bash
cd adeept_rasparms
python3 setup.py
```

If you see any errors come up while it's installing, let Mr. Bowman know.
